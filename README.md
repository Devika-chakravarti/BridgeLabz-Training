## 📅 Week 4: Structured the branch and Generics

### 🗓 Day 22 – Generics
**(Date: 09-Jan-2025)**

- Set up and revised the java-collections-practice branch structure

```
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling.
- Understood Type Parameters (`T`,`E`,`K`,`V`) and their role in APIs.
- Implemented Generic Classes and Generic Methods.
- Used Bounded Types (`extends`, `super`) to restrict and control types.
- Applied Wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`) for flexible collections.
- Followed Generics best practices (no raw types, safe bounds, readable design)

## 📅 Week 5: Collection frameworks

### 🗓 Day 27 – Collection frameworks (List, Set, Queue, Map)
**(Date: 16-Jan-2025)**

- Studied Java Collections Framework architecture and hierarchy.
- Understood the role of `Collection` and `Map` interfaces.
- Learned List Interface and its implementations:
  - `ArrayList`
  - `LinkedList`
  - `Vector`
- Performed common List operations:
  - Add, remove, update, search
  - Iteration using for-each, Iterator, and ListIterator
- Learned Set Interface and its implementations:
  - `HashSet`
  - `LinkedHashSet`
  - `TreeSet`
- Understood uniqueness, ordering, and sorting behavior in Sets.
- Learned Map Interface and its implementations:
  - `HashMap`
  - `LinkedHashMap`
  - `TreeMap`
- Performed key-value operations:
  - Insertion, deletion, retrieval
  - Iteration using entrySet(), keySet(), and values()
- Learned Queue Interface and its implementations:
  - `PriorityQueue`
  - `ArrayDeque`
- Studied queue operations:
  - Enqueue, dequeue, peek & poll
- Understood FIFO behavior and priority-based processing.
- Understood internal working, use cases, and performance considerations.
- Practiced real-time examples for List, Set, Queue and Map.
- Committed and pushed all work.
